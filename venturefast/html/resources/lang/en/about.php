                    VENTUREFAST is a service which allows participants to deposit their CS:GO skins and when there are 100 items in the pool or after 3 minutes pass from the time of the second deposit, the system determines one winner who gets all the deposited skins.

                <div class="page-block">
                    <ul>
                        <li>You deposit your items using the button "Join in", making a trade offer to our bot.<br>
                            <span>You can deposit 20 skins max, total worth of which cannot be less than 5$.</span></li>

                        <li>For every 0,01$ you will get one ticket (1$ - 100 tickets).<br>
                            <span>The chance of winning depends on the amount of tickets. Therefore, the higher the overall value of your deposits, the higher your chance of winning.</span></li>

                        <li>Once there will be 100 items in the pool or after 3 minutes pass from the time of the second deposit, the system will choose a random ticket through our <a href="/fairplay" target="_blank">Fair Play</a> system. The player who has this ticket will become the winner.</li>

                        <li>The winner gets all the deposits at the end of the round (taking into account our 5% to 8% commission) 1 minute after the end of the round.</li>

                        <li>You agree with the website’s terms of use every time You transfer the items.</li>
                        <li>Maximum trade is 20 items. There are no upper limits on the price of an item, also the minimum total worth of deposits has to be at least 5$.</li>
                        <li>In order to develop and maintain the project, we take a fee from each round - from 5% to 8% depending on the bank and the player’s level.</li>
                        <li>Only CS:GO items are allowed, other items will not be accepted.</li>
                        <li>We are not able to guarantee the correct evaluation of rare items, because we take the prices from the website csgo.steamanalyst.com, and they provide the average price of an item over the week from the Steam trading marketplace.</li>
                        <li>In case our bot gets banned within 30 minutes since the end of the round, we will compensate the winner only with his bet, not with the prize.</li>
                        <li>If you make a deposit at the end of the round, there is a chance that your skins will be transferred into a next game. We are not responsible for this: Steam doesn’t always process trades on a moment’s notice.</li>
